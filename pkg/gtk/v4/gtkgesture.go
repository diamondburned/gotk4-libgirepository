// Gesture: GtkGesture is the base class for gesture recognition.
//
// Although GtkGesture is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch
// gestures, it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures
// (using the special NULL GdkEventSequence value for these).
//
// The number of touches that a GtkGesture need to be recognized is controlled
// by the gtk.Gesture:n-points property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
// or more than that number of sequences, it won't check whether the gesture is
// recognized.
//
// As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, it will check
// regularly if it is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as
// "recognized" is left to GtkGesture subclasses.
//
// A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
//
// - gtk.Gesture::begin when the gesture is recognized.
//
// - gtk.Gesture::update, whenever an input event is processed.
//
// - gtk.Gesture::end when the gesture is no longer recognized.
//
//
// Event propagation
//
// In order to receive events, a gesture needs to set a propagation phase
// through gtk.EventController.SetPropagationPhase().
//
// In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
// target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
// get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
//
// In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
// toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get a
// chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
//
//
// States of a sequence
//
// Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
// GtkGestures, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and in
// parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the widgets
// using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly in order
// to enable cooperation of gestures around the GdkEventSequences triggering
// those.
//
// Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through gtk.Gesture.Group(). Grouped
// gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
// gtk.Gesture.SetSequenceState() on one will effectively propagate the state
// throughout the group.
//
// By default, all sequences start out in the GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
// sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
// propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
//
// If a sequence enters into the GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
// group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
// through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while the
// touch is active.
//
// If a sequence enters in the GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
// group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
//
// - Setting the same sequence to GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other
// gesture group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the
// propagation chain.
//
// - Emitting gtk.Gesture::cancel on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
// propagation chain.
//
// - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
//
// Note: if a sequence is set early to GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
// GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
// reaching the event widget, this implies GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar event
// will emulated if the sequence changes to GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED. This way
// event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped again.
//
// Sequence states can't be changed freely. See gtk.Gesture.SetSequenceState()
// to know about the possible lifetimes of a GdkEventSequence.
//
//
// Touchpad gestures
//
// On the platforms that support it, GtkGesture will handle transparently
// touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of GtkGesture should do
// to enable this support are:
//
// - If the gesture has GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
// GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the GtkGesture.
